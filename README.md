# Procore Helper

Chrome Extension that automates tedious tasks on Procore, a construction management webapp. Customized for Hathaway Dinwiddie Construction Company.

### Current Features

* Auto-populates RFI number and description when saving to a local drive. Click "Print RFI" on the Chrome Extension after exporting from the RFI page. Note that the RFI must be printed within 60sec as Procore removes the PDF file from their servers after 1 minute.

* Auto-populates email text body with a message requesting cost impacts when sending distributing RFIs. Click "Options" on the Chrome Extension to enter your name and duration of days that the subs have to notify HDCCo of costs. This message will autofill when using Procore's "Email" feature.

I haven't made a feature for submittals yet, but let me know if you need it. Also let me know if there are any other features you'd like to see.
